* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg
* As a user, I I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. this should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0
* As a user, I want to be able to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake
* As a user, I want to be able to edit just one of the properties and have the rest persist
* As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
* As a user, I want a keg to update to say "out of stock" once it's empty
* As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "almost emtpy" so i can try a pint before its gone
